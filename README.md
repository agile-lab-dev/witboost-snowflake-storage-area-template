This repository is part of our [Starter Kit](https://github.com/agile-lab-dev/witboost-starter-kit) meant to showcase witboost's integration capabilities and provide a "batteries-included" product.

# Snowflake Storage Area Template

- [Overview](#overview)
- [Usage](#usage)

## Overview

Use this template to create a database, a schema and tables within a Snowflake instance.

We will need to create all tables that will be used for the Data Product, specially the final table the Output Port will use to build the view exposed to the public.

Refer to the [witboost Starter Kit repository](https://github.com/agile-lab-dev/witboost-starter-kit) for information on the Specific Provisioner that can be used to deploy components created with this Template.

### What's a Template?

A Template is a tool that helps create components inside a Data Mesh. Templates help establish a standard across the organization. This standard leads to easier understanding, management and maintenance of components. Templates provide a predefined structure so that developers don't have to start from scratch each time, which leads to faster development and allows them to focus on other aspects, such as testing and business logic.

For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.witboost.agilelab.it/docs/p1_user/p6_advanced/p6_1_templates/#getting-started).

### What's a Storage Area?

A Storage Area is what the components of a Data Product use to persist data that is created or used by the various Workloads or served by Output Ports.

### Snowflake

Snowflake is a cloud based data warehousing platform that simplifies the management and analysis of massive amounts of data. Its architecture separates computation and storage resources, allowing them to scale independently according to demand. The key features include:

- Storage and Compute Separation: Unlike many traditional databases, Snowflake separates compute and storage resources, allowing each to scale independently. This ensures you pay only for the resources you use.
- Multi-Cloud Capability: Snowflake is a platform-agnostic service that can be run on major cloud providers such as AWS, GCP and Microsoft Azure.
- Zero Management: Snowflake is offered as a fully-managed service, which means you don't have to worry about infrastructure, indexes, partitions, or tuning to maintain peak performance.
- Security: It provides robust security features such as end-to-end encryption, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control to ensure data privacy and protection.
- Concurrency and Performance: Snowflake can handle large numbers of simultaneous users and queries without degrading performance.
- Time Travel: Snowflake allows you to access historical data at any point within a specified period, which can be up to 90 days. This can be used for data recovery or analytical purposes.
- Cloning: the clone capability allows us to quickly duplicate anything, including databases, schemas, tables, and other Snowflake objects, in almost real time.

Learn more about it on the [official website](https://www.snowflake.com/en/).

## Usage

### Prerequisites

A Data Product should already exist in order to attach the new components to it.

### Component basic information

This section includes the basic information that any Component of Data Mesh Boost must have

- Name: Required name used for display purposes on your Data Product
- Fully Qualified Name: Workload fully qualified name, this is optional as will be generated by the system if not given by you
- Description: A short description to help others understand what this Workload is for.
- Domain: The Domain of the Data Product this Workload belongs to. Be sure to choose it correctly as is a fundamental part of the Workload and cannot be changed afterwards.
- Data Product: The Data Product this Workload belongs to, be sure to choose the right one.
- Identifier: Unique ID for this new entity inside the domain. Don't worry to fill this field, it will be automatically filled for you.
- Development Group: Development group of this Data Product. Don't worry to fill this field, it will be automatically filled for you.
- Depends On: If you want your workload to depend on other components from the Data Product, you can choose this option (Optional).

*Example:*

| Field name              | Example value                                                                                          |
|:------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Name**                | Snowflake Vaccinations Storage                                                                         |
| **Description**         | Creates the vaccinations schema for this Data Product                                                  |
| **Domain**              | domain:healthcare                                                                                      |
| **Data Product**        | system:healthcare.vaccinationsdp.0                                                                     |
| ***Identifier***        | Will look something like this: *healthcare.vaccinationsdp.0.snowflake-vaccinations-storage*            |
| ***Development Group*** | Might look something like this: *group:datameshplatform* Depends on the Data Product development group |

### Snowflake deployment information

- Database: Name of the Database in the Snowflake. If left empty the Domain name will be set as default value.
- Schema: Name of the Schema inside a snowflake database. If left empty the value `<DP_name>_<DP_majorversion>` will be set as default value.

If you specify custom values (different from default ones) **you will need to remember them and insert the same values on the Airbyte component**, since we are assuming that the Airbyte component will store the data and create the related tables on the storage location provided by this component.

*Example:*

| Field name   | Example value  |
|:-------------|:---------------|
| **Database** | HEALTHCARE     |
| **Schema**   | vaccinationsdp |

### Creating tables using this component

We can take advantage of the full potential of this component which also allows us to create new tables within the newly created database. Although the form allows us only to create a new database with a schema, we can modify the `catalog-info.yaml` that is created in the Git repository to add custom table creation. Below we show an example of the syntax that needs to be added to the YAML file in order to create a new table.

**Since the tables and views are created at deployment time and not at template cloning time, remember to **always** add here the tables you will use in the data transformation stages (SQL or dbt) and in the Output Port.**

``` yaml
spec:
...
  mesh:
  ...
    specific:
      database: HEALTHCARE
      schema: vaccinationsdp_0
      tables:
      - tableName: vaccinations_clean
        schema:
        - name: date
          dataType: DATE
          constraint: NO CONSTRAINT
        - name: location_key
          dataType: TEXT
          constraint: PRIMARY KEY
        - name: new_persons_vaccinated
          dataType: NUMBER
          constraint: NULLABLE
        - name: new_persons_fully_vaccinated
          dataType: NUMBER
          constraint: NULLABLE
        - name: new_vaccine_doses_administered
          dataType: NUMBER
          constraint: NULLABLE
        - name: cumulative_persons_vaccinated
          dataType: NUMBER
          constraint: NULLABLE
        - name: cumulative_persons_fully_vaccinated
          dataType: NUMBER
          constraint: NULLABLE
        - name: cumulative_vaccine_doses_administered
          dataType: NUMBER
          constraint: NULLABLE
```
